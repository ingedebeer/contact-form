# JavaScript + Vue.js -> Assignment 6
## JS A6: <br>
* What the page does : <br>
  It's a contact form that requires a name, an email and a short message. <br>
  It has a pop-up to confirm submission and includes a short "thank you"-message. <br>
* Decisions and Validation : <br>
  The pop-up message confirms the info the user entered and that they're message is submitted. <br>
  Each line of the form is validated and shows errors when left blank to prevent automatic submission. <br>
  The email section validates that it is an email address being entered. <br>
  Each section has a minimum amount of letters to ensure accurate information. <br>
* Interactions - Modal : <br>
  When the user clicks "Send Message" the message appears.<br>
  The user can close this pop-up/modal by clicking the "X" in the corner. <br>
* Any challenges or decisions you made while working with JavaScript : 
  I struggled to see the use of Vue.js before actually using and testing it on sites. <br>
  When reading through the theory I got confused easily and applying it to the site without practice was difficult. <br>
  Deciding on a format for the modal without overwhelming the user was a challenge since many people don't like pop-ups. <br>
  There was an error in my code when I added this page and I needed to do a lot of reading to find and resolve it. <br>
  I misunderstood this assignment completely and had to redo it at the last minute because I coded this into my existing page. <br>
  (I am still not entirely clear on how this assignment should have been done honestly). <br>
